# [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```
