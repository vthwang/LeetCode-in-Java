# [77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return _all possible combinations of_ `k` _numbers chosen from the range_ `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
```
