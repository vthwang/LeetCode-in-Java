# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
