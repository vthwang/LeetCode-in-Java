# [540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return _the single element that appears only once_.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```
