# [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `i<sup>th</sup>` city and the `j<sup>th</sup>` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.
