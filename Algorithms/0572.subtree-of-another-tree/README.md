# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of ` subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```
