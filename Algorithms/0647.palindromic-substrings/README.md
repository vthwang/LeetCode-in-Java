# [647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **palindromic substrings** in it_.

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```
