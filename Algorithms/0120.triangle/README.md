# [120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   <u>2</u>
  <u>3</u> 4
 6 <u>5</u> 7
4 <u>1</u> 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10
```
