# [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
